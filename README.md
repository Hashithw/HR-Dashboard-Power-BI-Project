# HR Dashboard Power BI

This repository contains the project files and documentation for the "HR Dashboard Power BI Project" created using Microsoft Power BI. This dashboard is designed to provide insights into employee data, focusing on key HR metrics such as retention and workforce management.

## Project Overview

The HR Dashboard Power BI Project is structured to offer a comprehensive analysis of HR data, allowing for in-depth exploration and decision-making support. The project is divided into the following sections.

### 1. Connecting & Shaping the Data
In this phase, raw HR data from Kaggle (dataset link: https://bit.ly/4e8qn04) is connected and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. The data is carefully shaped to ensure accuracy and relevance for further steps.

### 2. Creating the Data Model
A robust data model is developed to establish relationships between different datasets, enabling seamless data interaction and comprehensive analysis.

### 3. Adding DAX Measures
Custom DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures are created to perform advanced calculations, enhancing the analytical capabilities of the data model and providing deeper insights into HR metrics.

### 4. Building the Report
The final report brings all elements together in a visually compelling and interactive dashboard. It includes pages for Home, Current Employee, Attrition, and tooltips that utilize current employee data. This report not only presents analytical findings but also offers a user-friendly interface for data exploration and strategic decision-making.
